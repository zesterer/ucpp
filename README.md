# ucpp
---

ucpp is a C++ library intended for use on freestanding platforms. It aims to replicate much of the behaviour found within the C++ standard library in addition to other useful features required by embedded platforms. ucpp does not intend to act as a drop-in replacement for C++'s standard library, not does to aim to achieve functionality parity with it.

## Why?

Embedded platforms are becoming increasingly popular. With the Internet of Things (IoT) growing rapidly and an increasingly active hobbyist OS development scene, low-level utility libraries that can be trusted to perform are important.

## Features

- [ ] Sensibly named types
- [ ] Fixed-width types
- [ ] String manipulation utilities
- [ ] Numeric parsing and composition (i.e: converting between numbers and strings)
- [ ] Simple mathematic functions
- [ ] Memory management functionality
- [ ] Smart pointers
- [ ] Thread-safe objects and syncronization utilities
- [ ] Safe abstractions (variants, optional values, etc.)
- [ ] Generic containers
- [ ] Simple heap implementations
- [ ] Platform-specific utilities (GDT and IDT support on x86)
